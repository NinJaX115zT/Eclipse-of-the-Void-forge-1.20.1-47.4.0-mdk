Message:
  This mod is a labor of love and a playful experiment in dark and semi-immersive gameplay.
  I made it for fun, without any malice, and I hope you enjoy exploring its chaos.
  Please don’t hate that I used AI to help me code, everyone does it nowadays. 
  And it's really helpful for people like me who don't really know how to code.
  Just please enjoy it! Maybe suggest ideas to me, and if any devs or artists want to make things better, I could use that help!
  Finally, I just wanted to say thanks for downloading/even giving this mod a go. Hope you enjoy!
